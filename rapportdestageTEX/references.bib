@article{GALLIAlain2001Roco,
abstract = {We show that the Gibbs Sampler in the Gaussian case is closely linked to linear fixed point iterations. In fact stochastic linear iterations converge toward a stationary distribution under the same conditions as the classical linear fixed point one. Furthermore the covariance matrices are shown to satisify a related fixed point iteration, and consequently the Gibbs Sampler in the gaussian case corresponds to the classical Gauss-Seidel iterations on the inverse of the covariance matrix, and the stochastic over-relaxed Gauss-Seidel has the same limiting distribution as the Gibbs Sampler. Then an efficient method to simulate a gaussian vector is proposed. Finally numerical investigations are performed to understand the effect of the different strategies such as the initial ordering, the blocking and the updating order for iterations. The results show that in a geostatistical context the rate of convergence can be improved significantly compared to the standard case.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@book{alma991004158221006616,
abstract = {This book provides an inter-disciplinary introduction to the theory of random fields and its applications. Spatial models and spatial data analysis are integral parts of many scientific and engineering disciplines. Random fields provide a general theoretical framework for the development of spatial models and their applications in data analysis. The contents of the book include topics from classical statistics and random field theory (regression models, Gaussian random fields, stationarity, correlation functions) spatial statistics (variogram estimation, model inference, kriging-based prediction) and statistical physics (fractals, Ising model, simulated annealing, maximum entropy, functional integral representations, perturbation and variational methods). The book also explores links between random fields, Gaussian processes and neural networks used in machine learning. Connections with applied mathematics are highlighted by means of models based on stochastic partial differential equations. An interlude on autoregressive time series provides useful lower-dimensional analogies and a connection with the classical linear harmonic oscillator. Other chapters focus on non-Gaussian random fields and stochastic simulation methods. The book also presents results based on the author's research on Spartan random fields that were inspired by statistical field theories originating in physics. The equivalence of the one-dimensional Spartan random field model with the classical, linear, damped harmonic oscillator driven by white noise is highlighted. Ideas with potentially significant computational gains for the processing of big spatial data are presented and discussed. The final chapter concludes with a description of the Karhunen-Loève expansion of the Spartan model. The book will appeal to engineers, physicists, and geoscientists whose research involves spatial models or spatial data analysis. Anyone with background in probability and statistics can read at least parts of the book. Some chapters will be easier to understand by readers familiar with differential equations and Fourier transforms.},

abstract = {We study the sample path regularity of a second-order random field
(Xt)t∈T where T is an open subset of Rd. It is shown that the conditions on its
covariance function, known to be equivalent to mean square differentiability of
order k, imply that the sample paths are a.s. in the local Sobolev space
Wloc k,2(T). We discuss their necessity, and give additional conditions for the
sample paths to be in a local Sobolev space Wloc μ,2(T) of fractional order μ.
This finally allows, via Sobolev embeddings, to draw conclusions about
a.s. continuous differentiability of the sample paths.},
